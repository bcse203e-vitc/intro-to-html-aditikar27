            When Thalia's tree is mysteriously poisoned, <br>
            the magical borders of Camp Half-Blood begin to fail.<br>
            Now Percy and his friends have just days to find the only magic item powerful to save the camp before it is overrun by monsters. <br>
            The catch: they must sail into the Sea of Monsters to find it.<br>
